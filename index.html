            <p id="white">I got started in the realm of software development at the library poking around on
                FreeCodeCamp.org. I earned my certificate in Responsive Web Design, and then enrolled at Interface
                in their Foundations of Web Development course. 
                I don't have much professional experience in this field, but my nontechnical jobs show that
                I commit. Previous jobs averaged 9 years each.

            <p class="bkgd">I spent a decade as a truck driver, and 5 years before that as a professional photographer.
                My years as a truck driver prepared me a lot for the seperation of concerns, putting pieces 
                of my code in individual locations.  That, and it made me want to get everything finished 
                early.  </br></br>
                My time as a photographer solidified my visual brain.<br>
                <br>
                Also, while I was driving for weeks, I kept a notebook 
                and pen with me.  I've done that my whole life.  I wrote some stuff.
